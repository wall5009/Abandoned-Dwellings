Abandoned-Dwellings
===================

A completely normal and not suspicious at all Minecraft mod that spawns abandoned buildings full of loot! _Don't look directly at the bugs._

You can find this structure in the Taiga, Snowy Taiga, Old Growth Spruce Taiga, Ice Spikes, Badlands, Bamboo Jungle, Wooded Badlands, Dark Forest, and Swamp!
